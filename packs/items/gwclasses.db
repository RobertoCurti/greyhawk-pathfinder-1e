Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\">Role: Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied skills and abilities allow them to be highly versatile, with great variations in expertise existing between different rogues. Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards and conning dull-witted opponents.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Alignment</strong>: Any</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Die</strong>: d8</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Starting Wealth</strong>: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.)

{"name":"Thaumaturgist (PrC)","type":"class","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/classesraces/thaumaturgist.png","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Thaumaturgist</h1><p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Source</strong> <em>DMG 3.5</em><br>The thaumaturgist reaches out with divine power to other planes of existence, calling creatures there to do his bidding. Evil thaumaturgists conspire with demons and devils to gain power on the Material Plane, while good thaumaturgists send powerful angels or eladrins on holy quests.</span></p><p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\">In combat, thaumaturgists often summon creatures from the Outer Planes to fight on their behalf. These creatures fade away as soon as the battle is over, but thaumaturgists also make agreements with mote powerful creatures for long-term service. The planar ally of a thaumaturgist is utterly devoted to furthering the thaumaturgist's goals (or the goals of a deity, if the thaumaturgist worships one).</span></p><p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\">Almost all thaumaturgists were once clerics, because the first step on the path of thaumaturgy is making an agreement with a denizen of the Outer Planes by use of the lesser planar ally spell. But many of the class abilities are useful to arcane spellcasters, so multiclassed cleric/wizards and the occasional cleric/sorcerer aren't unheard of.</span></p><p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\">A thaumaturgist is keenly aware that his unparalleled conjurations are just tools in service of his overall philosophy or deity. Thus, thaumaturgists often undertake quests to advance a cause, using their abilities to conjure up a strike force of summoned and called creatures at a moment's notice.</span></p><h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2><p>To qualify to become a Thaumaturgist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria:</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Spell Focus (conjuration)<br><strong>Spells:</strong> Able to cast lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding</p><h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2><p>The thaumaturgist's class skills are Craft, Diplomacy, Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (religion), Knowledge (the planes), Linguistic, Profession, Sense Motive, and Spellcraft.<br><br><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2><table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td><td><strong>Fort Save</strong></td><td><strong>Ref Save</strong></td><td><strong>Will Save</strong></td><td><strong>Special</strong></td><td><strong>Spellcasting</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>Improved Ally</td><td>+1 level of existing arcane class</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>Augment Summoning</td><td>+1 level of existing arcane class</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>Extend Summoning</td><td>+1 level of existing arcane class</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>Contingent Conjuration</td><td>+1 level of existing arcane class</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+3</td><td>Planar Cohort</td><td>+1 level of existing arcane class</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br>All of the following are features of the thaumaturgist prestige class.</p><p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Thaumaturgists gain no proficiency any weapon or armor.</p><p><strong>Spells per Day:</strong> When a new thaumaturgist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that be adds the level of thaumaturgist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.</p><p>If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a thaumaturgist, he must decide to which class he adds each level of thaumaturgist for the purpose of determining spells per day.</p><p><strong>Improved Ally:</strong> A thaumaturgist is adept at convincing creatures from other planes to do his bidding. When a thaumaturgist casts a planar ally spell (including the lesser and greater versions), he makes a Diplomacy check to convince the creature to aid him for a reduced payment. If the thaumaturgist's Diplomacy check adjusts the creature's attitude to helpful (see Influencing NPC Attitudes), the creature will work for 50% of the standard fee, as long as the task is one that is not against its nature. For example, a 1st-level thaumaturgist negotiating with an initially friendly planar ally that gets a Diplomacy check result of 15 can convince a 6 HD creature to perform a 7-hour task for only 1,500 gp per hour (a 6 HD creature would ordinarily ask for 3,000 gp per hour).</p><p>The thaumaturgist's improved ally class feature only works when the planar ally shares at least one aspect of alignment with the thaumaturgist. A thaumaturgist can have only one such ally at a time, but he may bargain for tasks from other planar allies normally.</p><p><strong>Augment Summoning:</strong> At 2nd level, a thaumaturgist gains the Augment Summoning feat.</p><p><strong>Extended Summoning (Ex):</strong> An 3rd level and higher, all spells from the summoning subschool that the thaumaturgist casts have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to them, The levels of the summoning spells don't change, however. This ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell's level.</p><p><strong>Contingent Conjuration (Su):</strong> A 4th-level thaumaturgist can prepare a summoning or calling spell ahead of time to be triggered by some other event. This functions as described for the contingency spell, including having the thaumaturgist cast the summoning or calling spell beforehand. The spell is cast instantly when the trigger event occurs. For example, a thaumaturgist could use the contingent conjuration ability to summon a barbed devil the next time he is attacked, or call a ghaele eladrin to act as messenger if the king falls ill.</p><p>The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. If complicated or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered. The conjuration spell occurs based solely on the conditions, regardless of whether the thaumaturgist wants it to, although most conjurations can be dismissed normally. A thaumaturgist can have only one contingent conjuration active at a time.</p><p><strong>Planar Cohort:</strong> A 5th-level thaumaturgist can use any of the planar ally spells to call a creature to act as his cohort. The called creature serves loyally and well as long as the thaumaturgist continues to advance a cause important to the creature. For example, a 5th-level thaumaturgist could use planar ally to call a bralani eladrin to act as his cohort. As long as the thaumaturgist undertakes the quests and missions to fight evil and uphold good, the eladrin will loyally serve. To call a planar cohort, the thaumaturgist must cast the relevant spell, paying the XP costs normally. It takes an offering of 1,000 gp x the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally class feature can not be used to reduce or eliminate this cost.

Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>\n<p><strong>Unchained:</strong> Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers.

Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\">Role: Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied skills and abilities allow them to be highly versatile, with great variations in expertise existing between different rogues. Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards and conning dull-witted opponents.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Alignment</strong>: Any</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Hit Die</strong>: d8</p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Starting Wealth</strong>: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.)

Divine oracles are such mortals, blessed - or cursed - by visions from their deities.</span></p><p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\">All divine oracles are spellcasters, and most were clerics or druids before adopting the divine oracle prestige class.

They are not proficient with any type of armor or with shields, but usually carry these proficiencies from their previous class.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> A divine oracle continues advancing in spellcasting ability as well as gaining the abilities of her new class. Thus, when a new divine oracle level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of divine oracle to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. For example, if Cassandra, a 10th-level cleric, gains a level as a divine oracle, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 11th level as a cleric, but uses the other divine oracle aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonuses. If she next gains a level as a cleric, making her an 11th-level cleric/1st-level divine oracle, she gains spells as if she had risen to 12th level as a cleric.</p><p>If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a divine oracle, the player must decide which class to assign each level of divine oracle for the purpose of determining spells per day.</p><p><strong>Prestige Domain:</strong> <span style=\"font-family: Signika, sans-serif\">Upon adopting the divine oracle class, the character gains access to the Divination domain.</span></p><p><strong>Scry Bonus (Su):</strong> <span style=\"font-family: Signika, sans-serif\">At 2nd level, a divine oracle has a sacred bonus on all Scry checks equal to half of it's class level.</span></p><p><strong>Prescient Sense (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, if a divine oracle makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally inflicts half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball spell), she instead suffers no damage, since her prescience allowed her to get out of the way faster. This form of evasion works no matter what armor the divine oracle wears, unlike the monk's and rogue's evasion ability.</p><p><strong>Divination Enhancement (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a divine oracle adds her divine oracle level to her percentage chance of success when using divination spells such as augury or divination. If an 11th-level cleric/4th-level divine oracle casts divination, her chance of success would be 70% (base) + 15% (1% per caster level) + 4% (her divine oracle level), or 89%.</p><p><strong>Instinct (Ex):</strong> A divine oracle hones her intuitive senses to utmost sharpness. Her reflexive quickness allows a divine to act and react seemingly faster than thought. At 5th level she gains the Uncanny Dodge Rogue Instinct.</p><p>At 7th level she gains the Celerity Rogue Instinct. At 9th level, the divine oracle gains the Improved Uncanny Dodge Rogue Instinct and can no longer be flanked, since she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than two times the divine oracle class level can flank her (and thus sneak attack her).</p><p>At 10th level she gains the Instinctive Awareness Rogue Talent, increasing the divine oracle's sensitivity to danger so that she is never surprised.</p><p><strong>Avoidance (Ex):</strong> At 6th, and again at 8th level, the divine oracle gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her the Trap Sense Rogue Avoidance.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.1Kr5phhDTPxOOtZ1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Avoidance (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/midjourney/mid-0031.png","level":6,"_index":0},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.aEqmdpMUU5ic4huu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divination Enhancement (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/midjourney/mid-0002.png","level":4,"_index":1},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.cH54djj5YhYZ2dJ3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Instinct (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/midjourney/mid-0054.png","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.GspMoEhojWM4U8Dx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Prescient Sense (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/midjourney/mid-0061.png","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.0PaomVsNoEzNM4as","dataType":"compendium","name":"Prestige Domain: Divination (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/midjourney/mid-0003.png","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.GhjW9m671lygMi03","dataType":"compendium","name":"Scry Bonus (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/midjourney/mid-0014.png","level":2,"_index":5}]},"tag":"divineOracle","useCustomTag":true,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"source":"Complete Divine  p. 34","source_type":"class"}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"customHD":"","identifiedName":"Divine Oracle (PrC)"},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"mBowgFU95wMOchUO":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"610440e2239410f707b77f15a5d7a973164ff3ee","sourceId":"Item.j8nSxhXqRVe3MrWf"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.etaXslJEDg2ji0ar"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1683798266147,"modifiedTime":1684657726506,"lastModifiedBy":"mBowgFU95wMOchUO"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"l5LKPvEfxaeP56Yw"}

Sometimes they serve or act in collusion with powerful evil characters, such as true necromancers or divine spellcasters with Death as one of their domains. Wherever pale masters go, undead follow. Often it is difficult to tell a pale master from the undead that he surrounds himself with.</span></p><h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2><p>To qualify to become a Pale Master, a character must fulfill all the following criteria:</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any non-good.<br><strong>Skills:</strong> Knowledge (Religion) 8 ranks.<br><strong>Feats:</strong> Skill Focus (Knowledge [religion]).<br><strong>Spells:</strong> Able to cast command undead and vampiric touch as arcane spells.<br><strong>Special:</strong> The candidate must have spent three or more days locked in a tomb with animate undead.

They gain no proficiency with any weapons or shields.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, a pale master gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a pale master, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.</p><p><strong>Animate Dead (Sp):</strong> Starting at 1st level, a pale master begins to exercise control over the undead. Once per day, he can use animate dead, as the spell, without need of a material component. Use the pale master's highest arcane caster level as the caster level for this effect. All other level restrictions of animate dead still apply. For example, a 6th-level sorcerer/3rd-level pale master can animate up to 16 HD of undead with a single use of this ability. Likewise, he can control up to 32 HD of undead created using this ability, the animate dead spell, or both.</p><p><strong>Inspired Necromancy (Ex):</strong> When determining the maximum number of Hit Dice of undead he can control with spells like animate dead, a character counts his Pale Master levels twice. This ability does not factor into how many undead he can create with a single casting of a spell. Thus, a Wizard 7/Pale Master 3 would be able to control 52 Hit Dice worth of undead with animate dead.</p><p><strong>Darkvision (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the dark begins to lose its mysteries to a pale master, who gains darkvision out to 60 feet. If he already has darkvision, its effective distance increases by 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Undead Armor Affinity (Ex):</strong> A pale master has an instinctive feel for undead armor. At 4th level and higher, he treats the undead armor as if its arcane spell failure chance were 10% less. At 8th level, this reduction improves to 20%.</p><p><strong>Control Undead (Sp):</strong> Once per day, a pale master of 5th level or higher can gain control over an undead creature (with Hit Dice equal to or less than his highest arcane caster level) by making a successful touch attack against it. The undead creature receives no saving throw to resist this effect. The control lasts for 1 round per class level. When the duration expires, the undead creature returns to its former allegiance, if any. The newly controlled undead can still be turned or rebuked as normal. This effect is otherwise identical to the control undead spell. This ability is in addition to the number of undead a pale master can control using his animate dead ability.</p><p><strong>Deathless Vigor (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 5th level, a pale master's body becomes more akin to the undying flesh of his undead associates. The character gains a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves except against effects that also work on objects.</p><p><strong>Undead Graft (Su):</strong> At 6th level, a pale master gives in to terrible necrophiliac urges. He cuts off his arm and replaces it with an undead prosthetic, which may be skeletal in form or preserved flesh stitched in place like that of a flesh golem. Regardless of its composition, the graft grants a +4 inherent bonus to the character's Strength score.</p><p>Additionally, the undead graft allows him to deliver horrible touch attacks. A pale master can use this ability once per day at 6th level, twice per day at 8th level, and three times per day at 10th level. The character must declare that he is using this ability before making the attack roll; a failed attack roll still expends that use of the ability. Each time he makes a touch attack using this ability, the pale master can select from any of the effect described below for which he meets the prerequisite class level. The save DC for the pale master's touch attacks is 10 + his pale master class level + his Cha modifier.</p><ul><li><p><em>Paralyzing Touch:</em> Any living foe except for an elf that is hit by a pale master's touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save a be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Prerequisite: Class level 6th.</p></li><li><p><em>Weakening Touch:</em> A living foe hit by a pale master's touch attack takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (no save). A creature reduced to Strength 0 dies. Prerequisite: Class level 7th.</p></li><li><p><em>Degenerative Touch:</em> A living foe hit by a pale master's touch attack receives one negative level (no save), and must make a Fortitude save 24 hours later to avoid losing the level permanently. Prerequisite: Class level 8th.</p></li><li><p><em>Destructive Touch:</em> A living foe hit by a pale master's touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. Prerequisite: Class level 9th.</p></li><li><p><em>Deathless Master's Touch:</em> A living foe of up to one size category larger than a pale master hit by the pale master's touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or die. A slain creature automatically animates 1 round later as a zombie and is under the pale master's control as if he had animated it. Undead created using this power do not count against a pale master's HD total for controlling undead. Prerequisite: Class level 10th.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Tough as Bone (Ex):</strong> On reaching 7th level, a pale master takes on even more of the qualities of an undead creature. He becomes immune to disease, nonlethal damage, and stunning.</p><p><strong>Undead Cohort:</strong> A 9th-level pale master gains the service of a loyal undead cohort. The cohort follows the rules for undead cohorts described under the Undead Leadership feat (see page 31, Libris Mortis). The pale master does not gain any followers from this ability, only a single cohort. The cohort's effective character level is determined by the pale master's Leadership score and character level exactly as if the cohort had been gained by means of the Undead Leadership feat.</p><p><strong>Deathless Mastery (Ex):</strong> On reaching 10th level, a pale master gains the virtues of his deathless arts. His body becomes partly mummified (though he is not truly undead), and he becomes immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, death effects, critical hits, ability drain, and energy drain, as well as damage to his physical ability scores (Str, Dex, and Con). He still needs to breathe, eat, and sleep as normal for his type, and he still ages normally.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.HBtlwDUn14Aj1Hi1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Animate Dead (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/spells/grasp_of_the_dead.png","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.vCuJXu4R8VvShuqR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Control Undead (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/TurnUndead.png","level":5,"_index":1},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.2vOZEdZDg4Wv36uZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Darkvision (PRC)","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/humanoid-single-blind.webp","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.YotypRVyKWRuWbQA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deathless Mastery (PRC)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_17.jpg","level":10,"_index":3},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.MImbnWKef1U8fS9l","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deathless Vigor (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/spells/ExplosionOfRot.png","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.4jIK0KinPwzf1Zxt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inspired Necromancy (PRC)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.HKqbebYS4U2y6tTM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tough as Bone (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/spells/Desecrate.png","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.2QSpq0qMTvO9Ap54","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undead Armor Affinity (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/boneArmorAffinity.png","level":4,"_index":7},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.HEul5d56F5izDxUW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undead Cohort (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/spells/CommandUndead.png","level":9,"_index":8},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.nFwn8lQZHgrqUvx6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undead Graft (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/midjourney/undeadGraft-003.png","level":6,"_index":9}]},"tag":"paleMaster","useCustomTag":true,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"source":"Libris Mortis: The Book of Undead p. 47","source_type":"class"}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"customHD":"","identifiedName":"Pale Master (PrC)"},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"mBowgFU95wMOchUO":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"4d3864e4e48872f465347ec3745207ed31c74013","sourceId":"Item.IxeResMGeLl58377"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.etaXslJEDg2ji0ar"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1683798266147,"modifiedTime":1684665767688,"lastModifiedBy":"mBowgFU95wMOchUO"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"khI1pEBBW1d9dBd8"}

Spending hours in prayer and meditation, these devoted followers purify their souls, fitting them for closer contact with the divine.

Such a character might have something a group of player characters needs - a holy relic, a bit of sacred lore, or simply a higher-level spell than the clerics in town can cast.</span></p><h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2><p>To qualify to become a Contemplative, a character must fulfill all the following criteria:</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Knowledge (religion) 10 ranks.<br><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.<br><strong>Special:</strong> Must have had direct contact with one's patron deity or a direct servant of that deity, or with an enlightened being embodying the highest principles of an alignment (a solar, for example).</p><h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2><p>The contemplative's class skills are Craft, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge (religion), Profession, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Survival.<br><br><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2><table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td><td><strong>Fort Save</strong></td><td><strong>Ref Save</strong></td><td><strong>Will Save</strong></td><td><strong>Special</strong></td><td><strong>Spellcasting</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>First prestige domain</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>Divine health</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>Slippery mind</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>Divine wholeness</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+3</td><td>Divine grace</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+3</td><td>Second prestige domain</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td><td>+4</td><td>Divine body</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+4</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>+4</td><td>Divine soul</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>+5</td><td>Eternal body</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+5</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>+5</td><td>Mystic union</td><td>+1 level of existing class</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br>All of the following are features of the contemplative prestige class.</p><p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Contemplatives are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any armor or with shields, but sometimes carry these proficiencies from their previous class.</p><p><strong>Prestige Domain:</strong> Upon adopting the contemplative class, and again at 6th level, a character gains access to a prestige domain of her choice. The character can choose any domain made available by her deity or alignment - either a new prestige domain or a standard domain listed in the Player's Handbook. The character gains the granted power associated with the domain she chooses, and can select the spells in that domain as her daily domain spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> A contemplative who was previously a divine spellcaster continues to gain access to more powerful divine magic while following the contemplative path. Thus, when a new contemplative level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in the divine spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, more frequent remove disease, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of contemplative to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. For example, if Theresa, an 11th-level cleric, gains a level as a contemplative, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 12th level as a cleric, but uses the other contemplative aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus. If she next gains a level as a cleric, making her a 12th-level cleric/1st-level contemplative, she gains spells as if she had risen to 13th level as a cleric.</p><p>If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a contemplative, the player must decide which class to assign each level of contemplative for the purpose of determining divine spells per day.</p><p>If the contemplative did not previously belong to a divine spellcasting class, she gains the ability to cast divine spells exactly as a cleric of her patron deity. Her spell progression is the same as that of a cleric.</p><p><strong>Divine Health (Ex):</strong> A contemplative is immune to all diseases, including magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycanthropy.</p><p><strong>Slippery Mind (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a contemplative gains the ability to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a contemplative with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment and fails her saving throw, one round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw.</p><p><strong>Divine Wholeness (Su):</strong> <span style=\"font-family: Signika, sans-serif\">At 4th level, a contemplative can cure her own wounds, in addition to any other healing ability she may have. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to her contemplative level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a contemplative can heal 1d6 hit points of damage. Using this ability is a swift action, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.</span></p><p><strong>Divine Grace (Su):</strong> At 6th level, a contemplative gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all Saving Throws.</p><p><strong>Divine Body (Su):</strong> At 7th level, a contemplative becomes immune to poisons of all kinds.</p><p><strong>Divine Soul (Su):</strong> At 8th level, a contemplative gains spell resistance. Her spell resistance equals her class level + 15. In order to affect the contemplative with a spell, a spellcaster must roll the contemplative's spell resistance or higher on 1d20 + the spellcaster's level.</p><p><strong>Eternal Body (Ex):</strong> After achieving 9th level, a contemplative no longer suffers ability penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. (Penalties she has already suffered remain in place.) Bonuses still accrue, and the contemplative still dies of old age when her time is up.</p><p><strong>Mystic Union (Su):</strong> At 10th level, a contemplative becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid. For instance, charm person does not affect her. Additionally, the contemplative gains damage resistance 20/+1. This means that the contemplative ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 20 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, by a spell, or by a form of energy (fire, cold, electricity, and so forth). As an outsider, a 10th-level contemplative is subject to spells that repel enchanted creatures, such as protection from good.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.3O4mY1ifuxgsMrLO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Body (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/alignmentChannel-004.jpg","level":7,"_index":0},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.6dtDDRm0slHiquSb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Grace (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/alignmentChannel-002.jpg","level":5,"_index":1},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.bag6itWKgRrR1rv1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Health (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/alignmentChannel-003.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.Lb1OYHyQKfAXsbAY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Soul (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/alignmentChannel-005.jpg","level":8,"_index":3},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.rVSwghDJamlZWGEy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Wholeness (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/alignmentChannel-001.jpg","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.WsPEqTWb0tS24mRp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mystic Union (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/magickStream.jpg","level":10,"_index":5},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.BBbj17Jhw8xrEFE4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Prestige Domain (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/enhancement.jpg","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.5FxC1dfxM7MZqAGa","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eternal Body (PRC)","img":"modules/greyhawk-pathfinder-1e/images/icons/featsfeatures/DefensiveStance.png","level":9,"_index":7},{"id":"greyhawk-pathfinder-1e.Greyhawk-Class-Features.wDKoAmzpD4qMWNc3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Slippery Mind (PRC)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal-gold.webp","level":3,"_index":8}]},"tag":"contemplative","useCustomTag":true,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"source":"Complete Divine p. 30","source_type":"class"}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":true,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"customHD":"","identifiedName":"Contemplative (PrC)"},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"mBowgFU95wMOchUO":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"d5aa97b5a33f39c8096de47db6dafba19b5b653d","sourceId":"Item.pK5su7h8gkTDZiwl"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.etaXslJEDg2ji0ar"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1683798266147,"modifiedTime":1684676668565,"lastModifiedBy":"mBowgFU95wMOchUO"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"VuW1O8O5BRSSHMgm"}
